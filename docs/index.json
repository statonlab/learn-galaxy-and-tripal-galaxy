	"content": "Docker Galaxy The Docker Galaxy image created by Björn Grüning is probably the mostly widely used Docker image for Galaxy. It has over 10k+ pulls from Docker hub. We are going to use this image to launch a Galaxy instance. Before we launch a Docker container, we need to get Docker installed. Instructions on Docker installation can be found on the offical Docker website.\nLaunch a Galaxy instance: docker run -i -t --rm \\ -p 80:80 -p 8021:21 -p 8022:22 \\ -e \u0026quot;ENABLE_TTS_INSTALL=True\u0026quot; \\ -e \u0026quot;GALAXY_CONFIG_ADMIN_USERS=example@gmail.com\u0026quot; \\ bgruening/galaxy-stable:17.01 /bin/bash  Command line arguments explanation:  -t: run docker container interactively. This will keep STDIN open even if not attached. -p: mapping the container’s ports to the host machines port. A nginx web server is running on port 80. Ports 21 and 22 are for FTP and SFTP protocols, respectively. We map these ports to a host port, so that we can interact with servers within the container through our host machine. -e \u0026quot;ENABLE_TTS_INSTALL=True\u0026quot;: enables tool installation from test tool shed. By default, only tool shed is available for Galaxy tool installation. -e \u0026quot;GALAXY_CONFIG_ADMIN_USERS=example@gmail.com\u0026quot;: register the email example@gmail.com as an admin user email. The user registered with this email will have admin permission on the Galaxy instance.   Start Galaxy So far, we have lunched a Docker container which has Galaxy installed. But we haven’t started Galaxy yet. We have logged into the Container as root user.\nMings-MacBook-Pro:~ mingchen$ docker run -i -t --rm \\ \u0026gt; -p 80:80 -p 8021:21 -p 8022:22 \\ \u0026gt; -e \u0026quot;ENABLE_TTS_INSTALL=True\u0026quot; \\ \u0026gt; -e \u0026quot;GALAXY_CONFIG_ADMIN_USERS=example@gmail.com\u0026quot; \\ \u0026gt; bgruening/galaxy-stable:17.01 /bin/bash root@fd2d0f70a407:/galaxy-central To start Galaxy, just run the command below within the container:\nstartup Once the starting process completes, you should see the Galaxy logs on your screen:\n==\u0026gt; /home/galaxy/logs/uwsgi.log \u0026lt;== galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp DEBUG 2017-12-07 03:27:15,199 Enabling \u0026#39;Batch\u0026#39; middleware galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp DEBUG 2017-12-07 03:27:15,199 Prior to webapp return, Galaxy thread \u0026lt;_MainThread(MainThread, started 140164177794880)\u0026gt; is alive.

Performing a complicated computational analysis can involve many many tools. We can install many tools into a Galaxy instance and save the installation work into a container. Next time when we need a Galaxy instance for data analysis, we can launch one with our own Galaxy container. The container will already have the tools we install before. We don’t need to go through the whole process again.\nTo build such a Galaxy container, we can simply run the command:\ndocker commit [CONTAINER ID] [DOCKER_USERNAME]/[CONTAINER_NAME]  [CONTAINER ID]: the container ID, which can be found by running the command docker ps -a. [DOCKER_USERNAME]: the username of your docker hub account. [CONTAINER_NAME]: the container name for identifying this container.  Let’s the see an example.\nRun the command below to get container ID: docker ps -a You should get something similar to this.\nCONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES fd2d0f70a407 bgruening/galaxy-stable:17.01 \u0026quot;/bin/bash\u0026quot; 13 hours ago Up 13 hours 443/tcp, 8800/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80-\u0026gt;80/tcp, 9002/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8021-\u0026gt;21/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8022-\u0026gt;22/tcp gallant_hugle You will get the container ID (fd2d0f70a407), which docker image (bgruening/galaxy-stable:17.01) you are using to launch your galaxy instance, and some other information.\n Build your own Galaxy image docker commit fd2d0f70a407 mingchen0919/my_own_galaxy Here my Docker hub account username is mingchen0919, and my docker image name is my_own_galaxy.\n Use your own Galaxy image We will use the same command to launch our galaxy instance.

You can run another commit to save your work to a new Galaxy image. Note if you have uploaded some datasets and done some analysis, the uploaded data and analysis will also be committed to your new image. You probably should commit your new image before running any analysis, unless you want to integrate it to your image.\nGet the new container ID by running docker ps -a.
