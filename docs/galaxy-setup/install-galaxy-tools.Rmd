## Register an admin account

You need admin permission to install tools in Galaxy. Let's create an admin account first. In the [previous section](/galaxy-setup/launch-galaxy-instance), we have set `example@gmail.com` as an admin user email. We can use this email to register an admin account.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/register-account-menu.png')
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/register-account-page.png')
```

If you successfully registered an admin account, you should be able to see `admin` on the tool menu on the top.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/register-account-admin.png')
```

## Install tools

Click the **admin** button and then click **Search Tool Shed** on the left menu.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/install-tool-search-tool.png')
```

The tool we are going to install is **fastqc**. This tool can be found on both `main tool shed` and `test tool shed` repository. We will install the tool from the `main tool shed`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/install-tool-toolshed.png')
```

On the tool search page, search for tool `fastqc`. You will find multiple different `fastqc` tools created by different developers. We are going to select the one owned by `devteam`. `devteam` represents a group of people from the development team of Galaxy.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/install-tool-fastqc.png')
```

We select the tool and click `Install to Galaxy` install.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/install-tool-fastqc-page.png')
```

We can install the tool to an exisint tool panel section. We can also install it to a new tool panel section. Here we install the `fastqc` tool to a new panel section.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/install-tool-tool-panel.png')
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/install-tool-installing.png')
```

Once the installation completes, we can go to the home page. The tool can be found on the `My Tools` panel section on the left. Clicking the tool will show you the tool interface.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/install-tool-panel-page.png')
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/install-tool-fastqc-interface.png')
```
