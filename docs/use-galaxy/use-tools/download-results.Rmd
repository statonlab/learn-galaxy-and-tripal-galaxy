```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

#### Download single dataset

We can select a single dataset on the history panel and click the **Download** icon to download the dataset from Galaxy to your local computer.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/use-tools/images/download-single-dataset.png')
```


#### Download multiple datasets

Galaxy allows you to export the entire history. It also allows you to copy datasets from one history to a new history. We can use this as a strategy to download multiple datasets at once.


Click the **History options** icon and then select **copy datasets**.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/use-tools/images/copy-datasets-to-history.png')
```


Copy selected datasets to a new history.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/use-tools/images/select-datasets.png')
```

Click **View all histories** button to display all history and switch to the history want to export.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/use-tools/images/view-all-histories-icon.png')
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/use-tools/images/all-histories.png')
```

Click the **History options** icon and then select **export history to file**. Once the exporting process is finished, you will be able to download the archived file through the generated link.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/use-tools/images/export-history.png')
```
