```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#### Upload local file

To upload a local file, click **Get Data->Upload File** on the left panel, then you will see the file uploading interface. Click **Choose local file** to upload your file.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/import-data/images/upload-local-file.png')
```

Most of times, galaxy tools can automatically detect uploaded file types. But you can manually set type for a single file or all files when uploading files.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/import-data/images/file-type-auto-detect.png')
```

#### Change data type

You can also change the data type after the file has been uploaded to Galaxy. In the example below, the uploaded file `V_corymbosum_scaffold_May_2013.fa.gff3` is supposed to be in `.gff3` format, but Galaxy detects it as a `.gff` file. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/import-data/images/change-file-type.png')
```

Go to the **history panel** on the right, click the dataset that you want to change data type. Click the **pencil icon**, then click **Datatype** on the new interface. Select the correct data type and click **Save**.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/use-galaxy/import-data/images/pencil-icon.png')
```

Click the Galaxy logo on the top left to go back to the home page. You will the data type is now `.gff3`.
