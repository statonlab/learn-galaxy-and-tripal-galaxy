## Register an admin account

You need admin permission to install tools in Galaxy. Let's create an admin account first. In the [previous section](/galaxy-setup/launch-galaxy-instance), we have set `example@gmail.com` as an admin user email. We can use this email to register an admin account.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/register-account-menu.png')
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/register-account-page.png')
```

If you successfully registered an admin account, you should be able to see `admin` on the tool menu on the top.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/galaxy-setup/images/register-account-admin.png')
```
